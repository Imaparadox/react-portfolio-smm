# React Portfolio SMM

This is a react-based application that showcases my portfolio!

## Description 

This application uses the react framework, and it was my first time using this framework. I plan to revisit in the near future to implement a better presentation and use Animate.css!

## Usage 

NOTE: Because of my footer, the particular extension I'm using to take screen shots refuses to showcase the entire page. Will return later to fix if possible.
